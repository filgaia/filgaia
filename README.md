### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Alejandro

I am a Systems Engineer with knowledge in Frontend technologies such as `Reactjs` and `Angular`, and backend technologies such as `nodejs`, `asp.net` and `java` anso I have more than 15 years of experience in technology.

I am a fan of **anime** and **video games** so I can assure you that my work that is related to technology I always do it for pleasure and not out of obligation.

What I enjoy the most about working with a client is learning about their business to enrich my knowledge in different areas.

I cannot assure you that I am the best technically in my area, but I can promise to help you form high-performance teams by contributing every little thing that I know and contributing with that different thinking that characterizes me.
